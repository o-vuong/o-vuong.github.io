When I started the CLI GEM assignment. A lot of things ran through my head, but the biggest was; "What am I going to make?". Took me all day to figure out what I wanted to do. I wanted to create a news scraper. When I started this project I was clueless on how to start the project. I figured that I would start watching videos on how to build a CLI GEM. I essentially just followed the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lDExWIhYKI) using that Avi from Flatiron was building. 


Starting the project I was pretty excited and wanted to see what else could I do. I wanted to do something that was pretty simple but that could be expanded once i figured something out. I ran into a lot of errors along the way. I used multiple friends to help me figure those errors out. But the best advice that I got from one of my friends was that I learned to debug my own code. After figuring out those tiny little errors, i started to trouble shoot small problems and try to figure out why my program is breaking. If I was asked to do this type of project from scratch again I believe that I would be able to do it in a lot less time than it took than i did with this one. 


Alot of what I did for this project I ended up on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) googled an error and majority of the time I usually ended up on that website. 


Most of my time spent on this project was pretty much trial and error trying to figure out how I should piece this project together.  A lot of self teaching and patience. Pretty much a puzzle except I'm creating hte pieces and figuring out how they fit together in the whole picture. 


Even once I published my GEM I'm still working on it to see what kind of improvements I can make to it.
