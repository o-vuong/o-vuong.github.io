Finishing up, to be honest, I didn't think that I would be able to finsh this course in one piece. A lot of self doubt came up as the course went on. Came really close to giving up and just wanting to drop EVERYTHING. The amount of information that I've learned and applied in the last 6 months really have been shocking. Seeing that my class size shinking by the week really was scary. I kept thinking what if I fell into that group that was falling behind. To my own surprise here I am,. Almost done with the coruse and on my way to enter the work force. I really am proud of the progress I've made to this point.
