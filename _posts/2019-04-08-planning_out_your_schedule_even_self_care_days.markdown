The one thing that I learned during the process of the course is the importance of planning out your week. Planning out a week is unbelivibly important. Just so you can manage and prioritize different obligations. Make room for yourself and still take care of what you need to take care of. One thing that people forget these days is to just stop. Stop and breathe. If you don't what is the point of pushing yourself so hard that you can't enjoy the reward of you putting in the work. Plan a day where you can just spend a couple hours to just be and focus on you.
