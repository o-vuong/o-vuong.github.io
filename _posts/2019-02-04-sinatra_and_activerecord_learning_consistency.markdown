Through out this assignment I started to connect a lot of dots as to how the sites we use and store our information. Granted the mothodology isn't the same but the general idea is. It was a lot of frustration that went into this assignment, overcoming the frustration  was going to be a major challenge. Asking a friend to take a look over my project he told me something right off the bat. "The way you're coding isn't very consistent. It's fine since you're starting out right now, but make it a habit **now** so you won't run into so many areas. Attention to detail Marine, attention to detail."

He was right looking back at my code it was a mess. The spacing was off, I would go from `"` to `'`. 

Practicing consistency is something I really need to work on .
