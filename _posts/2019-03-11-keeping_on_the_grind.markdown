The grind it really is something that people to say a lot these days. But something that they don't mention is that the grind can wear you down. Working on the my rails project it definatly wore me down. My confidence regarding this project isn't the greatest but it's something that im going to have to improve on. Taking a break would probably be the most beneficial. Tackling the many challenges of coding can be daunting sometimes not even your fault. But when the problem is solved you feel like you just ruled the world. Forcing us to become better problem solvers much faster
