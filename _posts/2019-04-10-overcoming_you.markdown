The biggest critic and obstical when doing something is always going to be you. There are always going to be moments when you're stuck working on something for a long period of time and you just feel lost and hopeless. At that moment is the moment that you go internal and talking down to yourself. Self depricating statements because you're stuck. Putting yourself down calling yourself dumb. When that happens it's important to stop working on the problems and think positive. You got this far why should you quit. This is just a small problem it's just big because you think it is. 

Take a step back and think objectivly:
1. What is the problem?
2. What is supposed to happen?
3. Problems are only big because we over complicate things. Have you had someone else look over the problem? Have you asked for their opinion?
4. Ask yourself provoking questions.

Tunnle vision is a trap that even the best fall into and not even realize it. Take a step back and look at the bigger picture. You will be able to see the solution a lot clearer when you do.
