When I started this project I was pretty confused and unsure how to start. Figuring out what you want to build is always the hardest. I would have hoenstly preferred being told what kind of application to build. But not telling us what to build was probably for the best. Made you think about the relationships between models and objects. "has_many" "belongs_to" and other relationships. Making you think about what apps are using those kind of relationships. 

When I submitted my project and was asked to add a search bar I was taken back. I wasn't too sure how to accomplish that goal. I worked on the problem for a couple days but I couldn't figure it out. I was just about to give up, but I decided to ask a developer friend to help me look over my code and see what I could be doing. The entire time he didn't tell me what todo more just ask me questions to help me solve my problem. I believe that was the socratic method he used with me. Talking out an issue and verbalizing it makes problem solving a lot easier.
